# Discover Schöneberg

A couple of weeks ago I had a free walking tour around my neighborhood, Schöneberg in Berlin, led by a local politician who is also very enthusiastic about local history. They said they are trying to offer several tours around the neighborhood to let the inhabitants discover the rich and diverse history of our neighborhood.

I then imagined how it would be to build a website for three of these free walking tours to target both old and newcomer local residents who are interested in discovering the history of the place they live in. The website offers them a quick and accessible way to sign up to 3 different tours.

When I participated the walking tour myself I noticed that most of the participants were above the age of 60 so I imagined this website to have a sleek but easy layout, with clear text and pastel colors which makes it more accessible for people who are less familiar with the internet.

The colors beside white used as theme for the website are the following:

## Design process

The first step in the designing process was to research interesting designs to draw inspiration from. I discovered a website called One Page Love and found this template called [MNTN](https://mntn.krystonschwarze.com/). I really liked the way the three sections alternate text and pictures. I decided I would try to reproduce the same layout for my webpage.

I then created a wireframe diagram in Microsoft Word because it is a program I am very familiar with:

![Wireframe Sign up](https://github.com/AlessandroRossi87/project1discoverschoneberg/blob/main/assets/readmeimgs/wireframe3.png)

Originally I had intended to make extensive use of pictures, for example using part of the hero image as a background for the nav bar section. Nevertheless I decided to backtrack from it when I started styling my webpage and went for a less ambitious but more clear design. I also decided to add an intro session with a presentation of who is behind the website and explain to the visitors why it is worth visiting Schöneberg with our free walking tours.

## Features

### Existing features

- **Navigation bar**

  - The navigation bar is featured on all three pages and has a very easy design with links to Home, Gallery and Sign up page.
  - This section enables the user to navigate easily between the three pages while always knowing on which page they are.

- **The hero section**

  - The hero section includes a photograph with a text overlay with the title of the website in uppercase and the description of the activities offered on this website.
  - On very wide screen I decided to let the hero text be on the top half of the hero box for stylistic reasons.
  - The section gives a clear idea of what to expect scrolling down the website and has a beautiful picture of the iconic Rathaus Schöneberg (Schöneberg City Hall) Metro station in Rudolph-Wilde-Park.

- **The intro section**

  - The intro section includes a welcoming paragraph with an inviting text about why we offer these tours and providing a catching description and short history of Schöneberg.
  - This section includes also the meeting location in bold text.

- **The tours section**

  - The tour section shows the user the three different tours offered with a picture exemplifying the content of each tour and the start time of each tour.
  - Each tour is identified by the color, the icon representing the tour, which we will find again in the Sign up section.

![Tours](https://github.com/AlessandroRossi87/project1discoverschoneberg/blob/main/assets/readmeimgs/tours.png)

- **The footer**

  - The footer includes like to three social media platforms where Discover Schöneberg would be present. All links open in a new tab when clicked upon.
  - The footer is colored in one of the two main colors and gives a balance to the white navigation bar.

- **The gallery**

  - The gallery provides the user an idea of all the places and buildings that will be featured in the walking tours.
  - This section is valuable because it shows the user, who might be local residents, that many of the places familiar to them actually have an interesting history and is a pull-factor for them to participate.

- **The Sign up page**
  - This section allows the user to sign up to one of the tours. The user will need to provide first name, last name and an e-mail address.

![Sign up](https://github.com/AlessandroRossi87/project1discoverschoneberg/blob/main/assets/readmeimgs/signup.png)

- **Future features**

  - I would like to add the possibility to have the webpage in different languages. For the sake of this project all text is in English but I would like to add German also.

## Testing

### Browser testing

This webpage has been tested on all major browser available to me (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge) and layout and functionality were ensured during all the testings.

### Lighthouse testing

During the first testing using the Lighthouse extension on Chrome I was receiving a low score for performance caused by the size of some images.

![First Lighthouse report ](https://github.com/AlessandroRossi87/project1discoverschoneberg/blob/main/assets/readmeimgs/lighthouse1.png)

I resolved this issue by resizing and compressing several images while also ensuring the consistency of their quality.

### Validator testing

- ## HTML

  - No errors were found when testing on [W3](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Falessandrorossi87.github.io%2Fproject1discoverschoneberg%2Findex.html)

- ## CSS
  - No errors were found when testing on [W3](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Falessandrorossi87.github.io%2Fproject1discoverschoneberg%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

## Accessibility

In order to enhance the accessibility of my webpage, also cosidered the targeted audience, I decided to make good use of ARIA-labels when deemed necessary. I have used a consistent but clear collor pallet which makes the text easy and pleasant to read.

## Deployment

The website was deployed on GitHub by following these steps:

- I went to the GitHub depository
- I clicked on "Settings" and then selected "main" in the "Default branch"
- I clicked on "Pages" and found the link to the deployed website.

Here is the link to the live website: https://alessandrorossi87.github.io/project1discoverschoneberg/index.html
