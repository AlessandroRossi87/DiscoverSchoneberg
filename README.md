Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **May 11th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!

# Discover Schöneberg

A couple of weeks ago I had a free walking tour around my neighborhood, Schöneberg in Berlin, led by a local politician who is also very enthusiastic about local history. They said they are trying to offer several tours around the neighborhood to let the inhabitants discover the rich and diverse history of our neighborhood.

I then imagined how it would be to build a website for three of these free walking tours to target both old and newcomer local residents who are interested in discovering the history of the place they live in. The website offers them a quick and accessible way to sign up to 3 different tours.

When I participated the walking tour myself I noticed that most of the participants were above the age of 60 so I imagined this website to have a sleek but easy layout, with clear text and pastel colors which makes it more accessible for people who are less familiar with the internet.

The colors used as theme for the website are rgb(98, 8, 25) and rgb(43, 40, 40)

## Features

### Existing features

#### Navigation bar

-The navigation bar is featured on all three pages and has a very easy design with links to Home, Gallery and Sign up page.
-This section enables the user to navigate easily between the three pages while always knowing on which page they are.

SCREENSHOT NAVBAR

#### The hero section

-The hero section includes a photograph with a text overlay with the title of the website in uppercase and the description of the activities offered on this website
-The section gives a clear idea of what to expect scrolling down the website and has a beautiful picture of the iconic Rathaus Schöneberg Metro station in Rudolph-Wilde-Park.

SCREENSHOT HERO SECTION

#### The intro section

-The intro section includes a welcoming paragraph with an inviting text about why we offer these tours and providing a catching description and short history of Schöneberg.
-This section includes also the meeting location in bold text.

SCREENSHOT INTRO SECTION

#### The tours section

-The tour section shows the user the three different tours offered with a picture exemplifying the content of each tour and the start time of each tour.
-Each tour is identified by the color, the icon representing the tour, which we will find again in the Sign up section.

SCREENSHOT TOUR SECTION

#### The footer

-The footer includes like to three social media platforms where Discover Schöneberg would be present. All links open in a new tab when clicked upon.
-The footer is colored in one of the two main colors and gives a balance to the white navigation bar.

SCREENSHOT FOOTER

#### The gallery

-The gallery provides the user an idea of all the places and buildings that will be featured in the walking tours.
-This section is valuable because it shows the user, who might be local residents, that many of the places familiar to them actually have an interesting history and is a pull-factor for them to participate.

SCREENSHOT GALLERY

-#### The Sign up page
-This section allows the user to sign up to one of the tours. The user will need to provide first name, last name and an e-mail address.

SCREENSHOT SIGN UP

### Future features

-I would like to add the possibility to have the webpage in different languages. For the sake of this project all text is in English but I would like to add German also.
