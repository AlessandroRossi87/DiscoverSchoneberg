# Discover Schöneberg

A couple of weeks ago I had a free walking tour around my neighborhood, Schöneberg in Berlin, led by a local politician who is also very enthusiastic about local history. They said they are trying to offer several tours around the neighborhood to let the inhabitants discover the rich and diverse history of our neighborhood.

I then imagined how it would be to build a website for three of these free walking tours to target both old and newcomer local residents who are interested in discovering the history of the place they live in. The website offers them a quick and accessible way to sign up to 3 different tours.

When I participated the walking tour myself I noticed that most of the participants were above the age of 60 so I imagined this website to have a sleek but easy layout, with clear text and pastel colors which makes it more accessible for people who are less familiar with the internet.

The colors used as theme for the website are rgb(98, 8, 25) and rgb(43, 40, 40)

SCREENSHOT NAVBAR

- The hero section includes a photograph with a text overlay with the title of the website in uppercase and the description of the activities offered on this website

- The footer includes like to three social media platforms where Discover Schöneberg would be present. All links open in a new tab when clicked upon.

SCREENSHOT FOOTER

- **The gallery**

- The gallery provides the user an idea of all the places and buildings that will be featured in the walking tours.
- This section is valuable because it shows the user, who might be local residents, that many of the places familiar to them actually have an interesting history and is a pull-factor for them to participate.

SCREENSHOT SIGN UP
